# Input Handler

The good way to manage all the input from users, is to delegate there management to a dedicated service.

This is why we start implementing a `InputHandler` service to capture keys input and in a near future, mouse and or touch events, and in a last step, gamepad and joystick input.

First things first, Keys !
